📊 Analysis Breakdown

1️⃣ Enrollment Analysis

Artificial Intelligence leads in enrollment (31 students), while Digital Marketing records the lowest.

Insights:
	•	AI shows strongest combined enrollment & revenue performance.
	•	Revenue success sometimes exceeds enrollment performance (Web Dev).
	•	Enrollment concentration risk exists in a few technical programs.
	•	Specialized programs require stronger market positioning.

⸻

2️⃣ Dropout Analysis

High-risk programs identified:
	•	Web Development
	•	Digital Marketing

Patterns observed:
	•	Lower average performance scores correlate with higher dropouts.
	•	Potential instructor workload imbalance may contribute.
	•	Dropouts directly reduce revenue and brand credibility.

⸻

3️⃣ Revenue Analysis

Key findings:
	•	Major campuses generate most revenue.
	•	Revenue targets are frequently underachieved.
	•	Installment payment structures impact cash flow.
	•	Revenue performance strongly correlates with enrollment volume and dropout rates.

This highlights forecasting and conversion inefficiencies.

⸻

4️⃣ Academic Performance Analysis
	•	Physical students outperform online students (Avg: 70.8 vs 64.5).
	•	Online mode has higher enrollment but lower academic performance.
	•	Data Science students demonstrate stronger academic outcomes.
	•	Practical modules favor physical study mode.

This reveals a delivery-quality gap in online education.

⸻

5️⃣ Instructor Workload Analysis
	•	A small number of instructors manage disproportionately high student volumes.
	•	Some instructors remain underutilized.
	•	Overloaded instructors increase risk of:
